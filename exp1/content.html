        *With bus location tracking systems, parents can easily check the location of their child's school bus using a mobile app or a web portal. They can see the bus's current position on a map, estimated arrival time, and even receive notifications for delays or changes in the bus route. This information enables parents to plan their schedules accordingly and ensure the safety of their children during pick-up and drop-off.

        *For school administrators, bus location tracking provides a centralized way to monitor and manage the school bus fleet. They can track multiple buses simultaneously, optimize routes, and make informed decisions based on real-time data. In case of emergencies or incidents, administrators can quickly identify the exact location of a bus and take appropriate actions.
